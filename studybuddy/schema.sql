'''
This schema defines the core data model for the StudyBuddy system
Users are stored in the users table, each with a unique int id
Availability also uses a unique int id to track each time slot
Courses are stored in the courses table identified by their course
code string, which is the primary key (PK)
 The enrollments table ties users -> courses, Primary key is the combination
of user_id + course_code so that the same student cannot be enrolled
in the same course more than once. Study sessions are stored in the
sessions table, each with a unique integer id, and participants are
tracked in session_participants, where the combination of session_id
+ user_id ensures a user can only appear once per session
'''
--Cascade ensures that when a user or session is deleted, their related data is also removed
-- Extra constraints ensure data is valid: days of the week must be
-- between 0 and 6, time slots must be within a 24-hour range with start
-- earlier than end, session statuses can only be pending, confirmed,
-- declined, or canceled, participant roles must be requester or invitee,
-- and responses must be accepted, pending, or declined.
